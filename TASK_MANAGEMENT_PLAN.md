# Task Management System Development Plan

## Project Overview

Building a simple task management application using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. The application will allow users to create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.2
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState)
- **Data Persistence**: Local Storage

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Install and configure Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Set up project folder structure
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Create Task interface/type definition
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Create main App component structure

### Phase 2: Core Task Management Features

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Implement task creation functionality
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Implement task display/list functionality
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Implement task completion toggle
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Implement task deletion functionality

### Phase 3: User Interface & Styling

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Design and implement task input form with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Style task list component with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Add task completion visual indicators
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Phase 4: Data Persistence

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Implement local storage for task persistence
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Add basic error handling

## Task Status Legend

- [ ] **Pending**: Task not started
- [x] **Completed**: Task finished and tested
- [üîÑ] **In Progress**: Currently working on this task
- [‚è∏Ô∏è] **Paused**: Task temporarily stopped
- [‚ùå] **Cancelled**: Task removed from scope

## Key Components to Build

### 1. Task Data Model

```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### 2. Main Components

- `App.tsx` - Main application component
- `TaskForm.tsx` - Form for creating tasks
- `TaskList.tsx` - List display of tasks
- `TaskItem.tsx` - Individual task component

### 3. Custom Hooks

- `useTasks.ts` - Task management logic
- `useLocalStorage.ts` - Local storage persistence

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can create tasks
- [ ] Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- [ ] Users can delete tasks
- [ ] Tasks persist between browser sessions
- [ ] Application is responsive and works on mobile devices
- [ ] Application uses Tailwind CSS for styling

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 tasks
2. Install and configure Tailwind CSS
3. Set up the basic project structure
4. Create the Task interface and basic components
5. Implement core functionality step by step
